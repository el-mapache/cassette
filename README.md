Record and save audio in your browser

## Usage Instructions

**This application depends on the latest version of Chrome! It uses the FileSystem API which, as far as I know, is only available in that browser!**

1. Clone the repo (assuming github ssh key)
`git clone git@github.com:el-mapache/cassette.git`

2. Change directory into the cloned repo:
`cd cassette`

3. Install dependencies with yarn
`yarn install`

4. Start up the server and visit the page in your browser â€” the default port the application runs on is 3003.
`yarn start`

5. Click record!
